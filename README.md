# balenalabs
balenaLabs (Labs) is an autonomous, public-facing, research and experimentation team within balena. We’re the most demanding users, and yet friendly. We’re balena’s biggest fans, its harshest critics, and have the responsibility of making sure that feedback is heard and actioned.

We go out into the world, demonstrate the potential of balena, gain attention, get feedback, and bring back our learnings to inspire and educate our team.

We build cool stuff and show it off, we make edge computing more accessible for our customers, and we make life easier for our users. We’re bringing people together into a new community to figure out this new industry and make IoT projects successful.

We’re exploring and communicating the potential of the balena platform, with the aim of accelerating its full realization.
